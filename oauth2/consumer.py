    """A consumer of OAuth-protected services.
 
    The OAuth consumer is a "third-party" service that wants to access
    protected resources from an OAuth service provider on behalf of an end
    user. It's kind of the OAuth client.
 
    Usually a consumer must be registered with the service provider by the
    developer of the consumer software. As part of that process, the service
    provider gives the consumer a *key* and a *secret* with which the consumer
    software can identify itself to the service. The consumer will include its
    key in each request to identify itself, but will use its secret only when
    signing requests, to prove that the request is from that particular
    registered consumer.
 
    Once registered, the consumer can then use its consumer credentials to ask
    the service provider for a request token, kicking off the OAuth
    authorization process.
